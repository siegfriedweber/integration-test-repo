= echo-service

The echo-service prints the content of the environment variable
`LOG_OUTPUT` to standard output and falls asleep.

A new line is appended so the content in `LOG_OUTPUT` should not end with
a new line character.

The capacity of environment variables depends on the system but it is safe
to store up to 120 kB in `LOG_OUTPUT`.

== Escape sequences

The following escape sequences are recognized:

* `\n`     new line
* `\\`     backslash

== Example

    $ LOG_OUTPUT='first line\nbackslash: \\\nheart: ♥' start.sh
    first line
    backslash: \
    heart: ♥
