= Integration test repo

== Purpose
The integration test repo contains a Stackable repository with services
used for the integration tests.

== Overview
The following services are available:

* link:noop-service/README.adoc[noop-service]:
  Performs no operation and just sleeps.
* link:echo-service/README.adoc[echo-service]:
  Prints the content of an environment variable to standard output.
* link:nostop-service/README.adoc[nostop-service]:
Performs no operation and just sleeps, but will ignore stop signals sent by systemd and have to be terminated by systemd.

== Contributing
The integration tests and the integration test repo are developed as open
source tools and we absolutely welcome any contributions! Don't hesitate
to drop us a line at info@stackable.de or reach out directly to any of our
committers/contributors.
